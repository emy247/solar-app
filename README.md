### `Description`

Solar-app is a web application built with React.js, Node.js, and Express that allows users to visualize estimates of the monthly and annual electricity production of a photovoltaic system based on its capacity, as well as the optimal tilt angles and orientations at which solar panels should be positioned to achieve such results. 

The server will retrieve data from an API provided by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. Subsequently, the data will be displayed on the client side in the form of charts, enabling users to analyze them.
